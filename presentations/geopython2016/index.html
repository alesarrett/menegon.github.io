title: Development and integration of geopython tools to support Integrated Coastal Management and Maritime Spatial Planning
description: "This talk aims to describe our experience using geo-python solutions and technologies to support research activities on the marine and coastal environment.Especially, we will describe the ADRIPLAN data and analyses portal (http://data.adriplan.eu/), an integrated web platform aimed at supporting Maritime Spatial Planning (MSP) activities and other
activities concerning the managing of marine environment for the Adriatic-Ionian macroregion. The main elements of the implemented solutions are: i) a GeoNode
(http://geonode.org/) platform for sharing geospatial datasets and maps; ii) a customized and integrated plugin (called MSP Tools) that enable the interactive analysis and
assessment of human uses, pressures and the potential impact of maritime and coastal activities on the environment; iii) an interactive computing environment based on Jupyter
notebook. GeoNode is a django-based web platform for developing community-based spatial data infrastructures (SDI). GeoNode makes it easy to upload and manage
geospatial data, to discover the resources and make content available via standard OGC protocols and to assemble web mapping applications. GeoNode leverages several
geospatial python libraries including pycsw, owslib and gsconfig. The MSP tools are the main methodological tools developed and used in the ADRIPLAN project. The tools
have been developed with the intent to carry out collaborative analyses and to improve the transparency of the whole analysis workflow. The MSP tools module allows users to
run experiments, simulations and analyses interacting directly with the data stored inside the Data Portal (GeoNode-based). The user can build several scenarios (called Case
Studies) by choosing the analysis area, the data layers, the analysis grid cell and produce and share the analysis results in terms of reports, tables, graphs and layers. The core
of the tools is a new python package called RectifiedGrid. RectifiedGrid, combining into a single class several python packages (e.g. Numpy, SciPy, shapely, rasterio, fiona,
geopandas, owslib, matplotlib-basemaps), simplifies geospatial grid-based analyses. Basically, it extends the numpy MaskedArray class by adding geospatial functionalities
(i.e. projection awareness, bounding boxes). RectifiedGrid employs rasterio and fiona under the hood for raster and vector I/O and owslib to access data through OGC
interoperable services. The ADRIPLAN data and analysis platform is completed by a Jupyter Notebook implementation which allows a more flexible and data exploration and
analysis. As final remarks of our experience, we have really appreciate the geopython ecosystem as base to implementing a community-based research platform. Python is a
versatile programming language that excels for gluing things together. The “geo” community is very large and constantly increasing and has all sorts of ready-made tools. The
ADRIPLAN data and analysis portal is currently under further development as well as the MSP tools in order to improve and sharpen their performance and make them more
versatile, and usable independently from the GeoNode platform. Consequently, at the end of this refactoring process, the MSP tools will be released as FOSS software."

        Case Study concept. It allows users to configure a
        simulation through a graphical interface: to choose the area
        of analysis, the grid cell size (hexagonal grid), to define
        the geographical resources (layers) to be used to model the
        different phenomena which can be, depending on the context,
        uses and activities or environmental components.  Each user
        can create more "Case Studies" and compare the results.

        The outputs from each run on “Case Studies” are
        automatically saved as “geographical layers” and published
        through the portal. The layer created is initially
        accessible only for admin users but it is possible to modify
        the access rules to allow the access also for other
        registered or non-registered users.

        For each "Case Study" a summary page is available that lists
        general information (e.g.  cells number, total score). In
        the next semester this information will be integrated with
        graphs and statistics automatically generated starting from
        the results of analyses.
